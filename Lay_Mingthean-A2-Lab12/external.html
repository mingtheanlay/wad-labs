          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
          describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
          included cues for the appearance of the document.

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
          constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
          embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
          structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
          elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
          such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other
          tags such as
        </p>
        <p>
          surround and provide information about document text and may include
          other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but
          use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          TML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
          JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
          Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
          Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
          maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
          explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

          In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
          prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
          documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
          Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and
          wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
          Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
          collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
          formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he
          listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put
          an encyclopedia first.
