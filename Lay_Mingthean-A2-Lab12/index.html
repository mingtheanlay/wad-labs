          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
          content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the
          page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
          formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
          the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
          methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
          browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS
          also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
          a mobile device.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
          determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
          particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        </p>

          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
          with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
          validation service for CSS documents.[5]

        </header>
        <p>
          CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to
          specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists
          of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more
          selectors, and a declaration block.

          Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support
          for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers
          do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been
          developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known
          as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality in CSS can
          be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example,
          Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features,
          which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's
          reputation among developers.[60] In order to ensure a consistent
          experience for their users, web developers often test their sites
          across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions,
          increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack
          have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of
          browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and the
          Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature
          queries, which provide an @supports directive that will allow
          developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality
          directly within their CSS.[61] CSS that is not supported by older
          browsers can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills,
          which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave
          consistently. These workarounds—and the need to support fallback
          functionality—can add complexity to development projects, and
          consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions
          that they will and will not support.
        </p>
        <p>
          As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with
          older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of
          the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).[62] Many of the
          most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on
          older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all, in
          large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web
          technologies.
