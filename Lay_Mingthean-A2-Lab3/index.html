    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
      Cambodia (/kæmˈboʊdiə/ (About this soundlisten);[9] also Kampuchea
      /ˌkæmpʊˈtʃiːə/; Khmer: កម្ពុជា [kam.pu.ciə]; French: Cambodge), officially
      the Kingdom of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា, prĕəh riəciənaacak
      kampuciə, IPA: [prĕəh riə.ciə.naː.caʔ kam.pu.ciə]; French: Royaume du
      Cambodge), is a country located in the southern portion of the Indochina
      peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is 181,035 square kilometres (69,898
      square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the
      northeast, Vietnam to the east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sovereign state of Cambodia has a population of over 15 million.
      Buddhism is enshrined in the constitution as the official state religion,
      and is practised by more than 97% of the population.[4] Cambodia's
      minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes.[10]
      The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and
      cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective constitutional
      monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal
      Council of the Throne as head of state. The head of government is the
      Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in
      Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer
      princes of Chenla under the name "Kambuja".[11] This marked the beginning
      of the Khmer Empire, which flourished for over 600 years, allowing
      successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast
      Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth. The Indianised kingdom
      facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of
      Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects
      throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000
      temples and monuments in Angkor alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous of
      these structures and is designated as a World Heritage Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifteenth century, after the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was
      formerly ruled by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline of
      power. Cambodia faced two increasingly powerful neighbors, Ayutthaya of
      Thailand and Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the downturn of
      Cambodia's fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France, and
      later was incorporated into French Indochina of Southeast Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953. The Vietnam War extended
      into the country in 1965 with the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and
      establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This led to the US bombing of
      Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the Cambodian coup of 1970 which
      installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer Republic, the deposed King Sihanouk
      gave his support to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge. With the support
      of the monarchy and North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge emerged as a major
      power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975. The Khmer Rouge then carried out the
      Cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam
      and the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the
      Soviet Union, in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, Cambodia was governed briefly by a
      United Nations mission (1992–93). The UN withdrew after holding elections
      in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The 1997
      factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime
      Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party, who remain in power as
      of April 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia is a member of the United Nations since 1955, ASEAN, the East
      Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie.
      According to several foreign organisations, the country has widespread
      poverty,[12] pervasive corruption,[13] lack of political freedoms,[14] low
      human development[15] and a high rate of hunger.[16][17][18] Cambodia has
      been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian Director, David
      Roberts, as a "relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial
      democracy".[19] Constitutionally a multi-party liberal democracy,[20] the
      country is de facto governed under one-party rule as of 2018.[21][22]
    </p>
    <p>
      While per capita income remains low compared to most neighboring
      countries, Cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, with
      growth averaging 7.6 percent over the last decade. Agriculture remains the
      dominant economic sector, with strong growth in textiles, construction,
      garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and
      international trade.[23] The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least
      developed country.[24] The US World Justice Project's 2015 Rule of Law
      Index ranked Cambodia 125th out of 126 countries, far lower compared to
      other countries in the region.[25]

      The "Kingdom of Cambodia" is the official English name of the country. The
      English "Cambodia" is an anglicisation of the French "Cambodge", which in
      turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer កម្ពុជា kampuciə.
      Kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in
      Khmer ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា prĕəh riəciənaacak kampuciə. The Khmer endonym
      Kampuchea derives from the Sanskrit name कम्बोजदेश kambojadeśa, composed
      of देश deśa ("land of" or "country of") and कम्बोज kamboja, which alludes
      to the foundation myths of the first ancient Khmer kingdom.[26] The term
      Cambodia was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since Antonio
      Pigafetta (an Italian explorer who followed Ferdinand Magellan in his
      circumnavigation of the globe) cites it in his work Relazione del primo
      viaggio intorno al mondo (1524–1525) as Camogia.[27]
    </p>
    <p>
      Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either ស្រុកខ្មែរ srok
      khmae (Khmer pronunciation: [srok ˈkʰmae]), meaning "Khmer's Land", or the
      slightly more formal ប្រទេសកម្ពុជា prɑteih kampuciə (Khmer pronunciation:
      [prɑ.ˈteih kam.pu.ciə]), literally "Country of Kampuchea". The name
      "Cambodia" is used most often in the Western world while "Kampuchea" is
      more widely used in the East.[28][29][30]

    <h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
    <h3><a name="pre-history">Pre-history</a></h3>
    <p>
      There exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of
      present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools
      found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Kratié
      provinces, and in Kampot Province, although their dating is
      unreliable.[32] Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of
      hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most ancient
      archaeological discovery site in Cambodia is considered to be the cave of
      L'aang Spean, in Battambang Province, which belongs to the Hoabinhian
      period. Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon
      dates around 6000 BC.[32][33] Upper layers in the same site gave evidence
      of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware
      ceramics in Cambodia.[34]
    </p>
    <p>
      Archaeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain
      equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was the slow
      penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the
      late 3rd millennium BC.[35] The most curious prehistoric evidence in
      Cambodia are the various "circular earthworks" discovered in the red soils
      near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s.
      Their function and age are still debated, but some of them possibly date
      from 2nd millennium BC
    </p>
    <p>
      Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not
      far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations
      began in 1875,[38] and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay
      Meanchey.[39] An excavation at Phum Snay revealed 21 graves with iron
      weapons and cranial trauma which could point to conflicts in the past,
      possible with larger cities in Angkor.[35][40] [41] Prehistoric artefacts
      are often found during mining activities in Ratanakiri.[32]
    </p>
    <p>
      Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the
      Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age
      settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian
      temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few
      kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of
      finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long
      distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already
      opened) and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence.
      Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across
      Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in
      southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The
      two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there
      was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd–4th century AD,
      probably with changes in socio-political powers.

    <p>
      During the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the Indianised states of Funan and
      its successor, Chenla, coalesced in present-day Cambodia and southwestern
      Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become Cambodia absorbed
      influences from India, passing them on to other Southeast Asian
      civilisations that are now Thailand and Laos.[43] Little else is known for
      certain of these polities, however Chinese chronicles and tribute records
      do make mention of them. It is believed that the territory of Funan may
      have held the port known to Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy as
      "Kattigara". The Chinese chronicles suggest that after Jayavarman I of
      Chenla died around 681, turmoil ensued which resulted in division of the
      kingdom into Land Chenla and Water Chenla which was loosely ruled by weak
      princes under the dominion of Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Khmer Empire grew out of these remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly
      established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c790-c835) declared
      independence from Java and proclaimed himself a Devaraja. He and his
      followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a series of
      conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th
      to the 15th centuries.[44] During the rule of Jayavarman VIII the Angkor
      empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan, however the king
      was able to buy peace.[45] Around the 13th century, monks from Sri Lanka
      introduced Theravada Buddhism to Southeast Asia.[46] The religion spread
      and eventually displaced Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular
      religion of Angkor; however it was not the official state religion until
      1295 when Indravarman III took power.[47]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th
      century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of
      capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an
      international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other
      modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest
      pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square
      kilometres (1,151 square miles).[48] The city, which could have supported
      a population of up to one million people[49] and Angkor Wat, the best
      known and best-preserved religious temple at the site, still serves as a
      reminder of Cambodia's past as a major regional power. The empire, though
      in decline, remained a significant force in the region until its fall in
      the 15th century.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="post-angkorian">Post-Angkor Period</a></h3>
    <p>
      After a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked
      by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological
      failure and infrastructure breakdown.[50][51] This led to a period of
      economic, social, and cultural stagnation when the kingdom's internal
      affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbours. By this
      time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased. Older faiths
      such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of the god-king had been
      supplanted by Theravada Buddhism.p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to regain
      its glory through maritime trade. The first mention of Cambodia in
      European documents was in 1511 by the Portuguese. Portuguese travellers
      described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade.
      Continued wars with Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of
      more territory and Longvek being conquered and destroyed by King Naresuan
      the Great of Ayutthaya in 1594. A new Khmer capital was established at
      Oudong south of Longvek in 1618, but its monarchs could survive only by
      entering into what amounted to alternating vassal relationships with the
      Siamese and Vietnamese for the next three centuries with only a few
      short-lived periods of relative independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hill tribe people in Cambodia were "hunted incessantly and carried off
      as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the
      Cambodians".[52][53]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nineteenth century a renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for
      control of Cambodia resulted in a period when Vietnamese officials
      attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs. This led to
      several rebellions against the Vietnamese and appeals to Thailand for
      assistance. The Siamese–Vietnamese War (1841–1845) ended with an agreement
      to place the country under joint suzerainty. This later led to the signing
      of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia by King Norodom
      Prohmborirak.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="french-colonisation">French Colonisation</a></h3>
    <p>
      In 1863, King Norodom, who had been installed by Siam,[11] sought the
      protection of Cambodia from Siam by French rule. In 1867, Rama IV signed a
      treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for
      the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became
      part of Siam. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty
      between France and Siam in 1907.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1867 to 1953,
      administered as part of the colony of French Indochina, though occupied by
      the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945.[54] Between 1874 and 1962, the
      total population increased from about 946,000 to 5.7 million.[55] After
      King Norodom's death in 1904, France manipulated the choice of king, and
      Sisowath, Norodom's brother, was placed on the throne. The throne became
      vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France
      passed over Monivong's son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently
      minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath
      was enthroned. The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to
      control.[54] They were wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom
      Sihanouk, Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.[54]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="vn-war">Independence and Vietnam War</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk.
      When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost hope of
      regaining control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam.
      Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the area had been controlled by the
      Vietnamese since 1698, with King Chey Chettha II granting the Vietnamese
      permission to settle in the area decades before.[56] This remains a
      diplomatic sticking point with over one million ethnic Khmers (the Khmer
      Krom) still living in this region. The Khmer Rouge attempted invasions to
      recover the territory which, in part, led to Vietnam's invasion of
      Cambodia and deposition of the Khmer Rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in
      politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960,
      Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the
      Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality
      in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use
      Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to
      their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as
      humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post
      journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to
      bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless
      Cambodians were killed.[57]
    </p>
    <p>
      The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester
      Bowles in January 1968.[58] However, in public Sihanouk refuted the right
      of the U.S. to use air strikes in Cambodia, and on 26 March he said "these
      criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop". On 28 March a
      press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international
      media: "I appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of
      Cambodia—that is, I will in any case oppose all bombings on Cambodian
      territory under whatever pretext." Nevertheless, the public pleas of
      Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued.[59] Members of the
      government and army became resentful of Sihanouk's ruling style as well as
      his tilt away from the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led
      by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. US
      support for the coup remains unproven.[60] However, once the coup was
      completed, the new regime, which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese
      communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of the United
      States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain
      their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately
      launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers
      to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil
      war.[61]
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However, from
      1970 until early 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the
      government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As
      they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese communists
      imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by
      the Cambodian communists now referred to as the Khmer Rouge.[63] Between
      1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam and US forces bombed Cambodia in an
      effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the
      North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the
      explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then
      second in command, Nuon Chea.[64] NVA units overran many Cambodian army
      positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their
      small-scale attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North
      Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon announced that US and
      South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at
      destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see Cambodian Incursion).[65]
      Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by
      US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces
      proved elusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three
      principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin Sirik Matak, and National
      Assembly leader In Tam. Lon Nol remained in power in part because neither
      of the others was prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was
      adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity,
      the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat
      force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the
      civilian administration and army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by
      supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and Ieng Sary
      asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of
      whom were purged. At the same time, the CPK forces became stronger and
      more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were
      fighting battles against government forces with little or no North
      Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's
      territory and 25% of its population. The government made three
      unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but
      by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA
      combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced
      to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More
      than 2 million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in
      117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic.
      Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down
      Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling
      the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition
      and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon
      Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days
      after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.[66]

    <h3><a name="khmer-rouge">Khmer Rouge regime, 1975–1978 </a></h3>
    <p>
      The Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975. Led by Pol Pot,
      they changed the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea. The
      new regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the Great Leap Forward,
      immediately evacuated the cities, and sent the entire population on forced
      marches to rural work projects. They attempted to rebuild the country's
      agriculture on the model of the 11th century, discarded Western medicine
      and destroyed temples, libraries, and anything considered Western.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime
      range from approximately one to three million; the most commonly cited
      figure is two million (about a quarter of the population).[67][68][69]
      This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol Sleng
      became notorious for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of thousands
      fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime
      disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims
      suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population
      exterminated.[70] Pol Pot was determined to keep his power and
      disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus increased his
      violent and aggressive actions against his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced
      the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in
      1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.[55] However, most of the victims of the
      Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer.
      Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were also targeted.
      According to Robert D. Kaplan, "eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow
      star" as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism.[72]
    </p>
    <p>
      Religious institutions were not spared by the Khmer Rouge either. Religion
      was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast
      majority of Cambodia's historic architecture, 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist
      temples, was completely destroyed.[73]

    </h3>
    <p>
      In November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in response to border
      raids by the Khmer Rouge.[74] The People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), a
      pro-Soviet state led by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a
      party created by the Vietnamese in 1951, and led by a group of Khmer Rouge
      who had fled Cambodia to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok, was
      established.[clarification needed][75] It was fully beholden to the
      occupying Vietnamese army and under direction of the Vietnamese ambassador
      to Phnom Penh. Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union.[76]
    </p>
    <p>
      In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile referred
      to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed
      in 1981 from three factions.[76] This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a
      royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National
      Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by the United Nations.
      The Khmer Rouge representative to the UN, Thiounn Prasith, was retained,
      but he had to work in consultation with representatives of the
      noncommunist Cambodian parties.[77][78] The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw
      from Cambodia led to economic sanctions[79] by the US and its
      allies.[specify]
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of Cambodia,
      culminating two years later in October 1991 in a Paris Comprehensive Peace
      Settlement. The UN was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal
      with refugees and disarmament known as the United Nations Transitional
      Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).[80]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="restoreation-of-the-monarchy"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In 1993, Norodom Sihanouk was restored as King of Cambodia, but all power
      was in the hands of the government established after the UNTAC sponsored
      elections. The stability established following the conflict was shaken in
      1997 by a coup d'état led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen against the
      non-communist parties in the government.[81] After its government was able
      to stabilize under Sen, Cambodia was accepted into the Association of
      Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 30 April 1999.[82][83] In recent years,
      reconstruction efforts have progressed and led to some political stability
      through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy.[4]
      Although Sen's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and
      corruption,[84] most Cambodian citizens through the 2000s maintained
      approval of the government; interviews with rural Cambodians in 2008
      displayed a preference for a stable status quo over potentially violent
      change.[85]
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2010, Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty
      of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former
      commandant of the S21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in
      prison.[86][87] However, Hun Sen has opposed extensive trials of former
      Khmer Rouge mass murderers.[88]
    </p>
    <p>
      In August 2014, a UN-backed war crimes tribunal, the Extraordinary
      Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (also known as the Khmer Rouge
      Tribunal), sentenced Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head
      of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue, to life in
      prison on war crimes charges for their role in the country's terror period
      in the 1970s. The trial began in November 2011. Former Foreign Minister
      Ieng Sary died in 2013, while his wife, Social Affairs Minister Ieng
      Thirith, was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012.

    <h2><a name="geography">Geography</a></h2>
    <p>
      Cambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles)
      and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10° and 15°N, and
      longitudes 102° and 108°E. It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos
      to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a
      443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand.[9][89]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is
      surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great
      Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward
      from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and
      rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms
      a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres)
      from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to
      1,800 feet (180–550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the
      Dângrêk Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowing south through Cambodia's eastern regions is the Mekong River. East
      of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern
      highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend
      into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland
      blocks, the Krâvanh Mountains and the Dâmrei Mountains, form another
      highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap
      and the Gulf of Thailand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's
      highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres).[90] The
      southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland
      strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the
      central plain by the southwestern highlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle
      Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles) during
      the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500
      square miles) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which
      is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia.[91] Much
      of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.[91]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="climate">Climate</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is dominated
      by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the
      distinctly marked seasonal differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35 °C (70 to 95 °F) and
      experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing
      moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May
      to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts
      from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation
      from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to
      February.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the International Development Research Center and The United
      Nations, Cambodia is considered Southeast Asia's most vulnerable country
      to the effects of climate change, alongside the Philippines.[92][93]
      Nearly all provinces in Cambodia are affected by climate change.[94] Rural
      coastal populations are particularly at risk. Shortages of clean water,
      extreme flooding, mudslides, higher sea levels and potentially destructive
      storms are of particular concern, according to the Cambodia Climate Change
      Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May
      to October, can see temperatures drop to 22 °C (72 °F) and is generally
      accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to
      April when temperatures can rise up to 40 °C (104 °F) around April.
      Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree
      of flooding almost every year.[95]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="ecology">Ecology</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodia's biodiversity is largely founded on its seasonal tropical
      forests, containing some 180 recorded tree species, and riparian
      ecosystems. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile
      species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine
      fish species recorded by science. Much of this biodiversity is contained
      around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere.[96]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a reserve surrounding the Tonle Sap
      lake. It encompasses the lake and nine provinces: Kampong Thom, Siem Reap,
      Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Oddar
      Meanchey and Preah Vihear. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a
      UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.[97] Other key habitats include the evergreen and
      dry Dipterocarp forests of Mondolkiri province, protected by Keo Seima
      Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and Srepok Wildlife
      Sanctuary, as well as Ratanakiri province, and the Cardamom Mountains
      ecosystem, including Preah Monivong National Park, Botum-Sakor National
      Park, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Samkos Wildlife
      Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Worldwide Fund for Nature recognises six distinct terrestrial
      ecoregions in Cambodia – the Cardamom Mountains rain forests, Central
      Indochina dry forest, Southeast Indochina dry evergreen forest, Southern
      Annamite Range tropical forest, Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forest, and
      Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forest.[98]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="environment">Environment</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodia has a bad but improving performance in the global Environmental
      Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 146 out of 180
      countries in 2016. This is among the worst in the Southeast Asian region,
      only ahead of Laos and Myanmar. The EPI was established in 2001 by the
      World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual
      countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable
      Development Goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The environmental areas where Cambodia performs worst on the EPI (i.e.
      highest ranking) are air quality (148), water resource management (140)
      and health impacts of environmental issues (137), with the areas of
      sanitation, environmental impacts of fisheries and forest management
      following closely. Cambodia has an unusually large expanse of protected
      areas, both on land and at sea, with the land-based protections covering
      about 20% of the country. This secures Cambodia a better than average
      ranking of 61 in relation to biodiversity and habitat, despite the fact
      deforestation, illegal logging, construction and poaching are heavily
      deteriorating these protections and habitats in reality, partly fueled by
      the government's placement of economic land concessions and plantations
      within protected areas.[99][100][101]
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world
      and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular environmental
      issue in the country.[101] Cambodia's primary forest cover fell from over
      70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. In total, Cambodia lost 25,000 km2
      (9,700 sq mi) of forest between 1990 and 2005 – 3,340 km2 (1,290 sq mi) of
      which was primary forest. Since 2007, less than 3,220 km2 (1,243 sq mi) of
      primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of
      the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat.[102][103]
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010–2015, the annual rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental
      degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a
      large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened
      with extinction due to loss of habitats. There are many reasons for the
      deforestation in Cambodia, which range from opportunistic illegal loggings
      to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural
      activities. The global issue of land grabbing is particularly rampant in
      Cambodia. The deforestation involves the local population, Cambodian
      businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all
      over the world.[104][105]
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, by
      Laos in particular, pose a "real danger to the food supply of Vietnam and
      Cambodia. Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast
      majority of Cambodia's protein and could also denude the Mekong River of
      the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket." The rich fisheries of Tonle
      Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, largely supply the
      impoverished country's protein. The lake is unusual: It all but disappears
      in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the Mekong
      backs up when the rains come. "Those fish are so important for their
      livelihoods, both economically and nutritionally", said Gordon Holtgrieve,
      a professor at the University of Washington who researches Cambodia's
      freshwater fish and he points out that none of the dams that are either
      built or being built on the Mekong river "are pointing at good outcomes
      for the fisheries".[106]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2010s, the Cambodian government and educational system has
      increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and
      international environmental groups.[107][108][109] A new National
      Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) for Cambodia is to be
      implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to
      incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the
      country.[110]

      In November 2017, the U.S. cut funds to help clear unexploded ordnance
      including land mines and chemical weapons in Cambodia which it had dropped
      during the Vietnam War.[111]

    <h3><a name="government">Government</a></h3>
    <p>
      National politics in Cambodia take place within the framework of the
      nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional monarchy
      operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister
      of Cambodia, an office held by Hun Sen since 1985, is the head of
      government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is the
      head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice
      and with the approval of the National Assembly. The prime minister and the
      ministerial appointees exercise executive power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral
      Parliament of Cambodia (សភាតំណាងរាស្ត្រ, saphea damnang reastr), which
      consists of a lower house, the National Assembly (រដ្ឋសភា, rotsaphea) and
      an upper house, the Senate (ព្រឹទ្ធសភា, protsaphea). Members of the
      123-seat Assembly are elected through a system of proportional
      representation and serve for a maximum term of five years. The Senate has
      61 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the
      National Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24
      provinces of Cambodia. Senators serve six-year terms.[112]
    </p>
    <p>
      On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special
      nine-member Royal Throne Council, part of a selection process that was
      quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week
      prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and
      National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's
      half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne
      council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially a multiparty democracy, in reality "the country remains a
      one-party state dominated by the Cambodian People's Party and Prime
      Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985. The
      open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access
      to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife, Bun Rany."[attribution
      needed][113] Cambodia's government has been described by the Human Rights
      Watch's Southeast Asian director, David Roberts, as a "relatively
      authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy".[19]
    </p>
    <p>
      Prime Minister Hun Sen has vowed to rule until he is 74.[114][115] He is a
      former Khmer Rouge member who defected. His government is regularly
      accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. The
      2013 election results were disputed by Hun Sen's opposition, leading to
      demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in
      Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing
      with riot police.[116] From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just
      33 when he took power in 1985, and is by some considered a long ruling
      dictator.[117]
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the 2017 crackdowns on political dissent and free press, Cambodia
      has been described as a de facto one-party state.[118][119][120]

      Hun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a
      former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the
      Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his
      strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary.[121]
      In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co–prime minister, Prince
      Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh
      and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other
      opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured, and some summarily
      executed.[121][122]

    <p>
      In addition to political oppression, the Cambodian government has been
      accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign
      investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers[123] as well
      as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit Cambodia's oil wealth
      and mineral resources.[124] Cambodia is consistently listed as one of the
      most corrupt governments in the world.[125][126][127] Amnesty
      International currently recognises one prisoner of conscience in the
      country: 33-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha.[128]

      Journalists covering a protest over disputed election results in Phnom
      Penh on 22 September 2013 say they were deliberately attacked by police
      and men in plain clothes, with slingshots and stun guns. The attack
      against the president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, Rick
      Valenzuela, was captured on video. The violence came amid political
      tensions as the opposition boycotted the opening of Parliament due to
      concerns about electoral fraud. Seven reporters sustained minor injuries
      while at least two Cambodian protesters were hit by slingshot projectiles
      and hospitalized.[129]

      In 2017 the Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition party,
      Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), paving the way for a return to a
      yet more authoritarian political system.[130]

    <h3><a name="corruption">Corruption</a></h3>
    <p>
      The level of corruption in Cambodia exceeds most countries in the world.
      Despite adopting an 'Anti-Corruption Law' in 2010, corruption prevails
      throughout the country. Corruption affects the judiciary, the police and
      other state institutions. Favouritism by government officials and impunity
      is commonplace. Lack of a clear distinction between the courts and the
      executive branch of government also makes for a deep politicisation of the
      judicial system.[131]
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of areas where Cambodians encounter corrupt practices in their
      everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with alleged
      traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts. Companies deal with
      extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially
      construction related permits, and the demand for and supply of bribes are
      commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provided no
      protection to whistle-blowers, and whistle-blowers can be jailed for up to
      6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.[131]

    <h3><a name="foreign-relations">Foreign relations</a></h3>
    <p>
      The foreign relations of Cambodia are handled by the Ministry of Foreign
      Affairs under Prak Sokhon. Cambodia is a member of the United Nations, the
      World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is a member of the
      Asian Development Bank (ADB), ASEAN, and joined the WTO in 2004. In 2005
      Cambodia attended the inaugural East Asia Summit in Malaysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has established diplomatic relations with numerous countries; the
      government reports twenty embassies in the country[132] including many of
      its Asian neighbours and those of important players during the Paris peace
      negotiations, including the US, Australia, Canada, China, the European
      Union (EU), Japan, and Russia.[133] As a result of its international
      relations, various charitable organisations have assisted with social,
      economic, and civil infrastructure needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several
      border disputes between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are
      disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with
      Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. Cambodia and Thailand also have
      border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to
      the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a deterioration in
      relations. Most of the territory belongs to Cambodia, but a combination of
      Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai troop upbuild in the area
      and lack of resources for the Cambodian military have left the situation
      unsettled since 1962.[134][135]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia and China have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese company
      with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a deep-water
      seaport along 90 km (56 mi) stretch of Cambodian coastline of the Gulf of
      Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently deep to be used by
      cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. Cambodia's diplomatic support has
      been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim disputed areas in the South
      China Sea. Because Cambodia is a member of ASEAN, and because under ASEAN
      rules "the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative",
      Cambodia is diplomatically useful to China as a counterweight to southeast
      Asian nations that have closer ties to the United States.[136]

    <h3><a name="military">Military</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Royal Cambodian Army, Royal Cambodian Navy, Royal Cambodian Air Force
      and Royal Gendarmerie collectively form the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,
      under the command of the Ministry of National Defence, presided over by
      the Prime Minister of Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the
      Supreme Commander of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), and the
      country's Prime Minister Hun Sen effectively holds the position of
      commander-in-chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction of a revised command structure early in 2000 was a key
      prelude to the reorganisation of the Cambodian military. This saw the
      defence ministry form three subordinate general departments responsible
      for logistics and finance, materials and technical services, and defence
      services under the High Command Headquarters (HCHQ).
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister of National Defense is General Tea Banh. Banh has served as
      defence minister since 1979. The Secretaries of State for Defense are Chay
      Saing Yun and Por Bun Sreu.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces comprised about 102,000 active
      personnel (200,000 reserve). Total Cambodian military spending stands at
      3% of national GDP. The Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia total more than
      7,000 personnel. Its civil duties include providing security and public
      peace, to investigate and prevent organised crime, terrorism and other
      violent groups; to protect state and private property; to help and assist
      civilians and other emergency forces in a case of emergency, natural
      disaster, civil unrest and armed conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hun Sen has accumulated highly centralised power in Cambodia, including a
      praetorian guard that 'appears to rival the capabilities of the country's
      regular military units', and is allegedly used by Hun Sen to quell
      political opposition.'[137] Cambodia signed the UN treaty on the
      Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[138]

    <h3><a name="legal-profession">Legal profession </a></h3>
    <p>
      The Cambodian legal profession was established in 1932. By 1978, due to
      the Khmer Rouge regime, the entire legal system was eradicated. Judges and
      lawyers were executed after being deemed "class enemies" and only 6–12
      legal professionals actually survived and remained in the country.[139]
      Lawyers did not reappear until 1995 when the Bar Association of the
      Kingdom of Cambodia was created.[140][141]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="human-rights">Human rights </a></h3>
    <p>
      A US State Department report says "forces under Hun Sen and the Cambodian
      People's Party have committed frequent and large-scale abuses, including
      extrajudicial killings and torture, with impunity".[142] According to the
      2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 256,800 people are enslaved in
      modern-day Cambodia, or 1.65% of the population.[143]
    </p>
    <p>
      Forced land evictions by senior officials, security forces, and
      government-connected business leaders are commonplace in Cambodia.[144]
      Land has been confiscated from hundreds of thousands of Cambodians over
      more than a decade for the purpose of self-enrichment and maintaining
      power of various groups of special interests.[145] Credible
      non-governmental organisations estimate that "770,000 people have been
      adversely affected by land grabbing covering at least four million
      hectares (nearly 10 million acres) of land that have been confiscated",
      says Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).[146]
    </p>
    <p>
      On 14 March 2018, the UN expert on the human rights situation in Cambodia
      "expressed serious concerns about restrictions on the media, freedom of
      expression and political participation ahead of a national election in
      July".[147] Some critics of the government have been arrested for
      allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic in
      Cambodia.[148][149]

    <h3><a name="administrative-divisions">Administrative divisions</a></h3>
    <p>
      The autonomous municipality (reach thani) and provinces (khaet) of
      Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided
      into 25 provinces including the autonomous municipality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Municipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions
      of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26
      municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further
      divided into communes (khum) and quarters (sangkat).

    <h2><a name="economy">Economy</a></h2>
    <p>
      In 2017 Cambodia's per capita income is $4,022 in PPP and $1,309 in
      nominal per capita. The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least
      developed country. Most rural households depend on agriculture and its
      related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are
      Cambodia's major exports. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
      reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia from its
      rice seed bank in the Philippines.[150] These varieties had been collected
      in the 1960s.

    <p>
      Based on the Economist, IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period
      2001–2010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with the
      highest annual average GDP growth. Tourism was Cambodia's fastest growing
      industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to over 2 million
      in 2007. In 2004, inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion US$.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Cambodia country assessment "Where Have All The Poor Gone? Cambodia
      Poverty Assessment 2013", the World Bank concludes: "Over the seven years
      from 2004 through 2011, Cambodian economic growth was tremendous, ranking
      amid the best in the world. Moreover, household consumption increased by
      nearly 40 percent. And this growth was pro-poor—not only reducing
      inequality, but also proportionally boosting poor people's consumption
      further and faster than that of the non-poor. As a result, the poverty
      rate dropped from 52.2 to 20.5 percent, surpassing all expectations and
      far exceeding the country's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) poverty
      target. However, the majority of these people escaped poverty only
      slightly: they remain highly vulnerable—even to small shocks—which could
      quickly bring them back into poverty."[151]
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two decades of economic growth have helped make Cambodia a global leader
      in reducing poverty. The success story means the Southeast Asian nation
      that overcame a vicious civil war now is classified as a lower-middle
      income economy by the World Bank Group (WBG). Among 69 countries that have
      comparable data, Cambodia ranked fourth in terms of the fastest poverty
      reduction in the world from 2004–2008. (See more details of Cambodia's
      achievements on poverty reduction. The poverty rate fell to 10 percent in
      2013, and further reduction of poverty is expected for both urban and
      rural households throughout 2015–2016. However, human development,
      particularly in the areas of health and education, remains an important
      challenge and development priority for Cambodia"[152]
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil and natural gas deposits found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters
      in 2005 yield great potential but remain mostly untapped, due in part to
      territorial disputes with Thailand.[153][154]
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Bank of Cambodia is the central bank of the kingdom and
      provides regulatory oversight to the country's banking sector and is
      responsible in part for increasing the foreign direct investment in the
      country. Between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and
      micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70
      individual institutions underlining the growth within the Cambodian
      banking and finance sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, Credit Bureau Cambodia was established with direct regulatory
      oversight by the National Bank of Cambodia.[155] The Credit Bureau further
      increases the transparency and stability within the Cambodian Banking
      Sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to
      report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the largest challenges facing Cambodia is still the fact that the
      older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside,
      which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed
      political instability and corruption within the government discourage
      foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been
      significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged
      $504 million to the country in 2004,[4] while the Asian Development Bank
      alone has provided $850 million in loans, grants, and technical
      assistance.[156] Bribes are often demanded from companies operating in
      Cambodia when obtaining licences and permits, such as construction-related
      permits.[157]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour
      in the 2015 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights
      Index, landing in the category of countries with "no guarantee of
      rights".'[158]
    </p>
    <p>
      In April 2016 Cambodia's National Assembly has adopted a Law on Trade
      Unions. "The law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging
      sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage
      increases and improvements in their working conditions".[159] The concerns
      about Cambodia's new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups,
      but international organisations more generally. The International Labour
      Organization Country Office for Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR, has noted
      that the law has "several key concerns and gaps".[160]
    </p>
    <p>
      Independent unions and employers remain divided. "How can a factory with
      25 unions survive?" asked Van Sou Ieng, chairman of the Garment
      Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), adding that it was
      "incomprehensible to expect an employer to negotiate a dispute with 25
      different union leaders. A law was necessary to rein in the country's
      unions, Van Sou Ieng said. According to GMAC, last year there were 3,166
      unions for the more than 500,000 workers employed in the country's 557
      garment and textile exporting factories, and 58 footwear factories. Though
      garment production is already Cambodia's largest industry, which accounts
      for 26.2 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product, Van Sou Ieng
      said without the trade union law, foreign investors will not come to do
      business".[161] "Only with the trade union law will we, employers, be able
      to survive.... not only Cambodia, every country has trade union law. Those
      who criticise [the law] should do businesses, and [then] they will
      understand."

    <h3><a name="textiles">Textiles</a></h3>
    <p>
      The garment industry represents the largest portion of Cambodia's
      manufacturing sector, accounting for 80% of the country's exports. In
      2012, the exports grew to $4.61 billion up 8% over 2011. In the first half
      of 2013, the garment industry reported exports worth $1.56 billion.[162]
      The sector employs 335,400 workers, of which 91% are female.

      Better Factories Cambodia was created in 2001 as a unique partnership
      between the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) and the
      International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group.
      The programme engages with workers, employers and governments to improve
      working conditions and boost competitiveness of the garment industry.[163]
      On 18 May 2018, the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) of the ILO Better
      Factories Cambodia Programme met in Phnom Penh to provide input into the
      draft conclusions and recommendations of the BFC's independent mid-term
      evaluation, as well as to discuss options on how to further strengthen the
      programme's transparent reporting initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the PAC concurred with the findings of the evaluation
      related to the impact the programme has had on the Cambodian garment
      sector and workers, including: a. contributing to sustained overall growth
      of the garment industry b. improving the lives of at least half a million
      Cambodian workers of factories in the BFC programme and many more of their
      family members; c. ensuring that workers receive correct wages and social
      protection benefits d. virtually eliminating child labour in the sector e.
      making Cambodia's garment factories safer overall f. creating a "level
      playing field" for labour across garment sector g. influencing business
      practices through (1) using factory data to highlight areas for
      improvement and (2) being a core part of risk management strategies of
      international brands/buyers.[164]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="tourism">Tourism</a></h3>
    <p>
      The tourism industry is the country's second-greatest source of hard
      currency after the textile industry.[80] International visitor arrivals in
      2018 topped six million, a ten-fold increase since the beginning of the
      21st century.[165]
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides Phom Penh and Angkor Wat, other tourist destinations include
      Sihanoukville in the southwest which has several popular beaches and
      Battambang in the northwest, both of which are popular stops for
      backpackers who make up a significant portion of visitors to
      Cambodia.[166] The area around Kampot and Kep including the Bokor Hill
      Station are also of interest to visitors. Tourism has increased steadily
      each year in the relatively stable period since the 1993 UNTAC
      elections.[167]
    </p>
    <p>
      Most international arrivals in 2018 were Chinese. Tourism receipts
      exceeded US$4.4 billion in 2018, accounting for almost ten percent of the
      kingdom's gross national product. The Angkor Wat historical park in Siem
      Reap Province, the beaches in Sihanoukville, the capital city Phnom Penh,
      and Cambodia's 150 casinos (up from just 57 in 2014)[168] are the main
      attractions for foreign tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's reputation as a safe destination for tourism however has been
      hindered by civil and political unrest [169][170][171] and several
      high-profile examples of serious crime committed against tourists visiting
      the kingdom.[172][173][174]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's tourist souvenir industry employs a lot of people around the
      main places of interest. The quantity of souvenirs that are produced is
      not sufficient to face the increasing number of tourists and a majority of
      products sold to the tourists on the markets are imported from China,
      Thailand, and Vietnam.[175] Some of the locally produced souvenirs
      include: Krama (traditional scarf) Ceramics Soap, candles, spices[176]
      Wood carvings, lacquerware, silver plate[177] Painted bottles containing
      infused rice wine.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="agriculture">Agriculture</a></h3>
    <p>
      Agriculture is the mainstay of the Cambodian economy. Agriculture
      accounted for 90 percent of GDP in 1985 and employed approximately 80
      percent of the work force. Rice is the principal commodity. Major
      secondary crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts,
      soybeans, sesame seeds, dry beans, and rubber. The principal commercial
      crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second
      only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="transport">Transport</a></h3>
    <p>
      The civil war and neglect severely damaged Cambodia's transport system.
      With assistance from other countries Cambodia has been upgrading the main
      highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from
      2006. Most main roads are now paved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometres (380 miles) of
      single, one-metre (3-foot-3-inch) gauge track.[178] The lines run from the
      capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast. Trains are again running
      to and from the Cambodian capital and popular destinations in the south.
      After 14 years, regular rail services between the two cities restarted
      recently – offering a safer option than road for travellers.[179] Trains
      also run from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (although trains often run only as
      far as Battambang). As of 1987, only one passenger train per week operated
      between Phnom Penh and Battambang but a US$141 million project, funded
      mostly by the Asian Development Bank, has been started to revitalise the
      languishing rail system that will "(interlink) Cambodia with major
      industrial and logistics centers in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City".[178]
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the main inter-provincial traffic artery connecting Phnom Penh
      with Sihanoukville, resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete / asphalt
      and bridging five major river crossings have now permanently connected
      Phnom Penh with Koh Kong, and hence there is now uninterrupted road access
      to neighbouring Thailand and its road network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's road traffic accident rate is high by world standards. In 2004,
      the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in
      Cambodia than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had
      doubled in the preceding three years.[180]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's extensive inland waterways were important historically in
      international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous
      tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length,
      including 3,700 kilometres (2,300 miles) navigable all year by craft
      drawing 0.6 metres (2.0 feet) and another 282 kilometres (175 miles)
      navigable to craft drawing 1.8 metres (5.9 feet).[181]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor
      ones. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle
      Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships
      during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season.
    </p>
    <p>
      With increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use,
      though motorcycles still predominate.[182] "Cyclo" (as hand-me-down
      French) or Cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly
      replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws
      imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist
      sits behind the passenger seat.[183]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has three commercial airports. In 2018, they handled a record of
      10 million passengers.[184] Phnom Penh International Airport is the
      busiest airport in Cambodia. Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the
      second busiest, and serves the most international flights in and out of
      Cambodia. Sihanouk International Airport, is in the coastal city of
      Sihanoukville.

      The first official census conducted by the French protectorate of Cambodia
      was in 1921; however, only men aged 20 to 60 were counted as its purpose
      was for the collection of taxes.[185] After the 1962 population census was
      conducted, Cambodia's civil conflicts and instability lead to a
      36-year-long gap before the country could have another official census in

      At present, fifty percent of the Cambodian population is younger than 22
      years old. At a 1.04 female to male ratio, Cambodia has the most
      female-biased sex ratio in the Greater Mekong Subregion.[187] Among the
      Cambodian population aged over 65, the female to male ratio is 1.6:1.[4]
    </p>
    <p>
      The total fertility rate in Cambodia was 2.5 children per woman in
      2018.[188] The fertility rate was 4.0 children in 2000.[189] Women in
      urban areas have 2.2 children on average, compared with 3.3 children per
      woman in rural areas.[189] Fertility is highest in Mondol Kiri and
      Rattanak Kiri Provinces, where women have an average of 4.5 children, and
      lowest in Phnom Penh where women have an average of 2.0 children.[189]

    <p>
      The vast majority of Cambodia's population is of ethnic Khmer origin (over
      95%) who are speakers of the Khmer language, the country's sole official
      language. Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its minority
      groups include Chams (1.2%), Vietnamese (0.1%) and Chinese (0.1%).[4]
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the Khmers, who comprise around
      90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland
      Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived
      near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where
      modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way
      to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an
      estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the
      country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese language has
      been determined to be a Mon–Khmer language, there are very few cultural
      connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were
      influenced by the Indian cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of
      the Chinese cultural sphere.[190] Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and
      the Vietnamese can be traced to the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to
      19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each
      attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively
      dominate all of Indochina.[190]
    </p>
    <p>
      Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.1% of the population.[191][192]
      Most Chinese are descended from 19th–20th-century settlers who came in
      search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French
      protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as
      Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning "Highland Khmer". They are
      descended from neolithic migrations of Mon–Khmer speakers via southern
      China and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast Asia. Being
      isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not
      Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally
      distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many
      pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a former
      kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and
      former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia number under a
      million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the
      country. Almost all Cham in Cambodia are Muslims.

    <h3><a name="languages">Languages</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Khmer language is a member of the Mon–Khmer subfamily of the
      Austroasiatic language group. French, once the language of government in
      Indochina, is still spoken by many older Cambodians, and is also the
      language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded
      by the government of France. There is also a French-language newspaper and
      some TV channels are available in French. Cambodia is a member of La
      Francophonie. Cambodian French, a remnant of the country's colonial past,
      is a dialect found in Cambodia and is sometimes used in government,
      particularly in court. Since 1993, there has been a growing use of
      English, which has been replacing French as the main foreign language.
      English is widely taught in several universities and there is also a
      significant press in that language, while street signs are now bilingual
      in Khmer and English.[194] Due to this shift, mostly English is now used
      in Cambodia's international relationships, and it has replaced French both
      on Cambodia's stamps and, since 2002, on Cambodian currency.[195]
    </p>
    <p>The Khmer script is derived from the South Indian Pallava script.</p>
    <h3><a name="religion">Religion</a></h3>
    <p>
      Theravada Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practised by more
      than 95 percent of the population with an estimated 4,392 monastery
      temples throughout the country.[196] Cambodian Buddhism is deeply
      influenced by Hinduism and native animism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The close interrelationship between spirits and the community, the
      efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms, and the
      possibility of manipulating one's life through contact with spiritual
      entities such as the "baromey" spirits originates from the native folk
      religion. Hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices of
      Tantricism and a host of Hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit world
      (for example, the important neak ta spirit called Yeay Mao is the modern
      avatar of the Hindu goddess Kali).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahayana Buddhism is the religion of the majority of Chinese and
      Vietnamese in Cambodia. Elements of other religious practices, such as the
      veneration of folk heroes and ancestors, Confucianism, and Taoism mix with
      Chinese Buddhism are also practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Islam is followed by about 2% of the population and comes in three
      varieties, two practised by the Cham people and a third by the descendants
      of Malays, resident in the country for generations. Cambodia's Muslim
      population is reported to be 80% ethnic Cham.[197]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="health">Health</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodian life expectancy was 69 years in 2018,[198] a major improvement
      since 1995 when the average life expectancy was 55.[199] Health care is
      offered by both public and private practitioners and research has found
      that trust in health providers is a key factor in improving the uptake of
      health care services in rural Cambodia.[200] The government plans to
      increase the quality of healthcare in the country by raising awareness of
      HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia's infant mortality rate has decreased from 86 per 1,000 live
      births in 1998 to 24 in 2018.[201] In the province with worst health
      indicators, Ratanakiri, 22.9% of children die before age five.[202]
      Cambodia was once one of the most landmined countries in the world.
      According to some estimates, unexploded land mines have been responsible
      for over 60,000 civilian deaths and thousands more maimed or injured since
      1970.[203] The number of reported landmine casualties has sharply
      decreased, from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 (22 dead and 89 injured).[204]
      Adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more
      limbs and have to resort to begging for survival.[203] Cambodia is
      expected to be free of land mines by 2020[205] but the social and economic
      legacy, including orphans and one in 290 people being an amputee,[206] is
      expected to affect Cambodia for years to come. In Cambodia, landmines and
      exploded ordnance alone have caused 44,630 injuries between 1979 and 2013,
      according to the Cambodia Mine/UXO Victim Information System.[207]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="education">Education</a></h3>
    <p>
      The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for
      establishing national policies and guidelines for education in Cambodia.
      The Cambodian education system is heavily decentralised, with three levels
      of government, central, provincial and district – responsible for its
      management. The constitution of Cambodia promulgates free compulsory
      education for nine years, guaranteeing the universal right to basic
      quality education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2008 Cambodian census estimated that 77.6% of the population was
      literate (85.1% of men and 70.9% of women).[4] Male youth age (15–24
      years) have a literacy rate of 89% compared to 86% for females.[208]
    </p>
    <p>
      The education system in Cambodia continues to face many challenges, but
      during the past years there have been significant improvements, especially
      in terms of primary net enrolment gains, the introduction of program
      based-budgeting, and the development of a policy framework which helps
      disadvantaged children to gain access to education. The country has also
      significantly invested in vocational education, especially in rural areas,
      to tackle poverty and unemployment. [209][210] Two of Cambodia's most
      acclaimed universities are based in Phnom Penh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, education in Cambodia was offered by the wats (Buddhist
      temples), thus providing education exclusively for the male
      population.[211] During the Khmer Rouge regime, education suffered
      significant setbacks. Education has also suffered setbacks from child
      labour, A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in
      Cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with
      late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes, and
      increased drop out rates.[212]
    </p>
    <p>
      With respects to academic performance among Cambodian primary school
      children, research showed that parental attitudes and beliefs played a
      significant role.[213] Specifically, the study found that poorer academic
      achievement among children were associated with parents holding stronger
      fatalistic beliefs (i.e., human strength cannot change destiny). The study
      further found that "length of residence" of parents in the community in
      which they stay predicted better academic achievement among their
      children. Overall, the study pointed out to the role of social capital in
      educational performance and access in the Cambodian society in which
      family attitudes and beliefs are central to the findings.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="crime">Crime</a></h3>
    <p>
      In 2017, Cambodia had a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 population.[214]
      Prostitution is illegal in Cambodia but yet appears to be prevalent. In a
      series of 1993 interviews of women about prostitution, three quarters of
      the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a norm and a profession
      they felt was not shameful having.[215] That same year, it was estimated
      that there were about 100,000 sex workers in Cambodia.[215] On 18 August
      2019, Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a directive banning the Finance
      Ministry from issuing new online gambling licenses, while operators
      currently holding online licenses would only be allowed to continue
      operating until those licenses expire. The directive cited the fact that
      "some foreigners have used this form of gambling to cheat victims inside
      and outside the country" as justifying the new policy.[216] Cambodia had
      issued over 150 such licenses before the new policy was announced.[217]
    </p>
    <h2><a name="culture">Culture</a></h2>
    <p>
      Various factors contribute to the Cambodian culture including Theravada
      Buddhism, Hinduism, French colonialism, Angkorian culture, and modern
      globalization. The Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is
      responsible for promoting and developing Cambodian culture. Cambodian
      culture not only includes the culture of the lowland ethnic majority, but
      also some 20 culturally distinct hill tribes colloquially known as the
      Khmer Loeu, a term coined by Norodom Sihanouk to encourage unity between
      the highlanders and lowlanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rural Cambodians wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of Cambodian
      clothing. The sampeah is a traditional Cambodian greeting or a way of
      showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the
      Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture,
      which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand throughout
      history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means "city" and Wat means "temple") is the
      best preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era along
      with hundreds of other temples that have been discovered in and around the
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, the Khmer people have a recorded information on Tra leaves.
      Tra leaf books record legends of the Khmer people, the Ramayana, the
      origin of Buddhism and other prayer books. They are taken care of by
      wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and the climate.[218]
    </p>
    <p>
      Bon Om Touk (Cambodian Water & Moon Festival), the annual boat rowing
      contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end
      of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its
      normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately
      10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year to play games,
      give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, dine, and attend the boat race
      in a carnival-type atmosphere.[219]
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular games include soccer, kicking a sey, which is similar to a
      footbag, and chess. Based on the classical Indian solar calendar and
      Theravada Buddhism, the Cambodian New Year is a major holiday that takes
      place in April. Recent artistic figures include singers Sinn Sisamouth and
      Ros Serey Sothea (and later Preap Sovath and Sokun Nisa), who introduced
      new musical styles to the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year, Cambodians visit pagodas across the country to mark the Pchum
      Ben (Ancestors' Day). During the 15-day festival, people offer prayers and
      food to the spirits of their dead relatives. For most of the Cambodians,
      it is a time to remember their relatives, who died during 1975–1979 Khmer
      Rouge regime.[220]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="cuisine">Cuisine</a></h3>
    <p>
      Rice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast Asian countries. Fish from
      the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The
      supply of fish and fish products for food and trade as of 2000 was 20
      kilograms (44 pounds) per person or 2 ounces per day per person.[221] Some
      of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cuisine of Cambodia contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key
      ingredients are kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce,
      curry, tamarind, ginger, oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. Some
      delicacies are នំបញ្ចុក (Num Banh chok), អាម៉ុក (Amok), អាពីង (Ah Ping).
      The country also boasts various distinct local street foods, such as fried
      spiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      French influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red curry
      with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the
      curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and rice
      vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, kuy teav, is
      a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green onions
      that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp, pork
      liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to be the best in the world and
      accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks and squid in the restaurants on
      the Ou Trojak Jet river.[222] The cuisine is relatively unknown to the
      world compared to that of its neighbours Thailand and Vietnam.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="drinks">Drinks</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodians drink plenty of tea, grown in Mondulkiri Province and around
      Kirirom.[223] tai krolap is a strong tea, made by putting water and a mass
      of tea leaves into a small glass, placing a saucer on top, and turning the
      whole thing upside down to brew. When it's dark enough, the tea is
      decanted into another cup and plenty of sugar added, but no milk. Lemon
      tea tai kdao kroich chhmaa, made with Chinese red-dust tea and lemon
      juice, is refreshing both hot and iced, and is generally served with a
      hefty dose of sugar.[224]
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding coffee, the beans are generally imported from Laos and Vietnam –
      although domestically produced coffee from Ratanakiri Province and
      Mondulkiri Province can be found in some places. Beans are traditionally
      roasted with butter and sugar, plus various other ingredients that might
      include anything from rum to pork fat, giving the beverage a strange,
      sometimes faintly chocolatey aroma.[224]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia has several industrial breweries, located mainly in Sihanoukville
      Province and Phnom Penh. There are also a growing number of microbreweries
      in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.[225][226] Between 2014 and 2018, the number
      of craft beer breweries rose from two to nine. As of 2019, there are 12
      brewpubs or microbreweries in Cambodia.[227]
    </p>
    <p>
      Rice wine is a popular alcoholic drink. Its quality varies widely and it
      is often infused with fruits or medicinal herbs.[228] When prepared with
      macerated fruits or spices, like the Sombai liqueur, it is called sraa
      tram (or soaked wine) and has gained more and more popularity with the
      development of tourism as it is smoother to drink than plain rice
      wine.[229][230][231]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="women">Women</a></h3>
    <p>
      Khmer women are traditionally expected to be modest, soft-spoken,
      well-mannered,[232] industrious,[233] act as the family's caregivers and
      caretakers[232] and financial controllers,[233] maintain their virginity
      until marriage, become faithful wives,[232] and act as advisors to their
      husbands.[233] The "light" walking and refinement of Cambodian women is
      further described as being "quiet in [...] movements that one cannot hear
      the sound of their silk skirt rustling".[233] As financial controllers,
      the women of Cambodia can be identified as having household authority at
      the familial level.[234]
    </p>
    <h3><a name="sports">Sports</a></h3>
    <p>
      Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although professional
      organised sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in western countries
      because of the economic conditions. Soccer was brought to Cambodia by the
      French and became popular with the locals.[235] The Cambodia national
      football team managed fourth in the 1972 Asian Cup, but development has
      slowed since the civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Western sports such as basketball, volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey,
      rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity. Volleyball is by
      far the most popular sport in the country. Native sports include
      traditional boat racing, buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional
      wrestling and Bokator. Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during
      the 1956 Summer Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also
      hosted the GANEFO Games, the alternative to the Olympics, in the 1960s.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="dance">Dance</a></h3>
    <p>
      Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical
      dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of Khmer classical
      dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms
      back to the time of Angkor, seeing similarities in the temple engravings
      of the period, while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were
      learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Khmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art established
      in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited for both entertainment and
      ceremonial purposes.[236] The dances are performed by intricately
      costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for tribute,
      invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as Reamker,
      the Khmer version of the Ramayana.[237] Known formally as Robam Preah
      Reach Trop (របាំព្រះរាជទ្រព្យ "theater of royal wealth") it is set to the
      music of a pinpeat ensemble accompanied by a vocal chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodian folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates the
      various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated in
      the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for
      the villagers.[238] The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn
      is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes,
      Chams or farmers. Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances
      display themes of the "common person" such as love, comedy or warding off
      evil spirits.[238]
    </p>
    <p>
      Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other
      informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous
      to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the circle
      dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern
      western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have
      also influenced Cambodian social dance.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="music">Music</a></h3>
    <p>
      Traditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire.[239]
      Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture as
      are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music
      include Chapei and A Yai. The former is popular among the older generation
      and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar
      (chapei) in between a cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or
      religious theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in
      nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres,
      that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and ad-libbed. When
      sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, "answering" the other's verse
      or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks
      in between verses. Pleng kaah (lit. "wedding music") is a set of
      traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as
      accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long
      Khmer wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or a
      mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in
      particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner Sinn Sisamouth
      and Ros Sereysothea from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the
      classic pop music of Cambodia. During the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many
      classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved
      to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge.[240] and many original
      master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States) and
      others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their
      popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of
      kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern
      instrumentation.[241]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Australian hip hop group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak
      Channthy, a native born Cambodian female singer.[242][243]
    </p>
    <p>

      A National Committee for Science and Technology representing 11 ministries
      has been in place since 1999. Although seven ministries are responsible
      for the country's 33 public universities, the majority of these
      institutions come under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth
      and Support.[244]

      In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support approved a Policy on
      Research Development in the Education Sector. This move represented a
      first step towards a national approach to research and development across
      the university sector and the application of research for the purposes of
      national development.[244]
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy was followed by the country's first National Science and
      Technology Master Plan 2014–2020. It was officially launched by the
      Ministry of Planning in December 2014, as the culmination of a two-year
      process supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The plan
      makes provision for establishing a science and technology foundation to
      promote industrial innovation, with a particular focus on agriculture,
      primary industry and ICTs.[244][245]
