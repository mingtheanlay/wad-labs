      Cambodia (/kæmˈboʊdiə/ (About this soundlisten);[9] also Kampuchea
      /ˌkæmpʊˈtʃiːə/; Khmer: កម្ពុជា [kam.pu.ciə]; French: Cambodge), officially
      the Kingdom of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា, prĕəh riəciənaacak
      kampuciə, IPA: [prĕəh riə.ciə.naː.caʔ kam.pu.ciə]; French: Royaume du
      Cambodge), is a country located in the southern portion of the Indochina
      peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is 181,035 square kilometres (69,898
      square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the
      northeast, Vietnam to the east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sovereign state of Cambodia has a population of over 15 million.
      Buddhism is enshrined in the constitution as the official state religion,
      and is practised by more than 97% of the population.[4] Cambodia's
      minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes.[10]
      The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and
      cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective constitutional
      monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal
      Council of the Throne as head of state. The head of government is the
      Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in
      Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer
      princes of Chenla under the name "Kambuja".[11] This marked the beginning
      of the Khmer Empire, which flourished for over 600 years, allowing
      successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast
      Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth. The Indianised kingdom
      facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of
      Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects
      throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000
      temples and monuments in Angkor alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous of
      these structures and is designated as a World Heritage Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifteenth century, after the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was
      formerly ruled by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline of
      power. Cambodia faced two increasingly powerful neighbors, Ayutthaya of
      Thailand and Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the downturn of
      Cambodia's fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France, and
      later was incorporated into French Indochina of Southeast Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953. The Vietnam War extended
      into the country in 1965 with the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and
      establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This led to the US bombing of
      Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the Cambodian coup of 1970 which
      installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer Republic, the deposed King Sihanouk
      gave his support to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge. With the support
      of the monarchy and North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge emerged as a major
      power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975. The Khmer Rouge then carried out the
      Cambodian genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam
      and the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the
      Soviet Union, in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, Cambodia was governed briefly by a
      United Nations mission (1992–93). The UN withdrew after holding elections
      in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The 1997
      factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime
      Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party, who remain in power as
      of April 2020.

      Cambodia is a member of the United Nations since 1955, ASEAN, the East
      Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie.
      According to several foreign organisations, the country has widespread
      poverty,[12] pervasive corruption,[13] lack of political freedoms,[14] low
      human development[15] and a high rate of hunger.[16][17][18] Cambodia has
      been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian Director, David
      Roberts, as a "relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial
      democracy".[19] Constitutionally a multi-party liberal democracy,[20] the
      country is de facto governed under one-party rule as of 2018.[21][22]
    </p>
    <p>
      While per capita income remains low compared to most neighboring
      countries, Cambodia has one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, with
      growth averaging 7.6 percent over the last decade. Agriculture remains the
      dominant economic sector, with strong growth in textiles, construction,
      garments and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and
      international trade.[23] The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least
      developed country.[24] The US World Justice Project's 2015 Rule of Law
      Index ranked Cambodia 125th out of 126 countries, far lower compared to
      other countries in the region.[25]

      The "Kingdom of Cambodia" is the official English name of the country. The
      English "Cambodia" is an anglicisation of the French "Cambodge", which in
      turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer កម្ពុជា kampuciə.
      Kampuchea is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in
      Khmer ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា prĕəh riəciənaacak kampuciə. The Khmer endonym
      Kampuchea derives from the Sanskrit name कम्बोजदेश kambojadeśa, composed
      of देश deśa ("land of" or "country of") and कम्बोज kamboja, which alludes
      to the foundation myths of the first ancient Khmer kingdom.[26] The term
      Cambodia was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since Antonio
      Pigafetta (an Italian explorer who followed Ferdinand Magellan in his
      circumnavigation of the globe) cites it in his work Relazione del primo
      viaggio intorno al mondo (1524–1525) as Camogia.[27]
    </p>
    <p>
      Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either ស្រុកខ្មែរ srok
      khmae (Khmer pronunciation: [srok ˈkʰmae]), meaning "Khmer's Land", or the
      slightly more formal ប្រទេសកម្ពុជា prɑteih kampuciə (Khmer pronunciation:
      [prɑ.ˈteih kam.pu.ciə]), literally "Country of Kampuchea". The name
      "Cambodia" is used most often in the Western world while "Kampuchea" is
      more widely used in the East.[28][29][30]

    <p>
      There exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of
      present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools
      found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Kratié
      provinces, and in Kampot Province, although their dating is
      unreliable.[32] Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of
      hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most ancient
      archaeological discovery site in Cambodia is considered to be the cave of
      L'aang Spean, in Battambang Province, which belongs to the Hoabinhian
      period. Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon
      dates around 6000 BC.[32][33] Upper layers in the same site gave evidence
      of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware
      ceramics in Cambodia.[34]
    </p>
    <p>
      Archaeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain
      equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was the slow
      penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the
      late 3rd millennium BC.[35] The most curious prehistoric evidence in
      Cambodia are the various "circular earthworks" discovered in the red soils
      near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s.
      Their function and age are still debated, but some of them possibly date
      from 2nd millennium BC
    </p>
    <p>
      Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not
      far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations
      began in 1875,[38] and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay
      Meanchey.[39] An excavation at Phum Snay revealed 21 graves with iron
      weapons and cranial trauma which could point to conflicts in the past,
      possible with larger cities in Angkor.[35][40] [41] Prehistoric artefacts
      are often found during mining activities in Ratanakiri.[32]
    </p>
    <p>
      Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the
      Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age
      settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian
      temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few
      kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of
      finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long
      distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already
      opened) and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence.
      Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across
      Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in
      southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The
      two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there
      was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd–4th century AD,
      probably with changes in socio-political powers.
