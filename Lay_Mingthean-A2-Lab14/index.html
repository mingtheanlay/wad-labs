          In metal typesetting, a font was a particular size, weight and style
          of a typeface. Each font was a matched set of type, one piece (called
          a "sort") for each glyph, and a typeface consisting of a range of
          fonts that shared an overall design.

          In modern usage, with the advent of digital typography, "font" is
          frequently synonymous with "typeface". Each style is in a separate
          "font file"—for instance, the typeface "Bulmer" may include the fonts
          "Bulmer roman", "Bulmer", "Bulmer bold" and "Bulmer extended"—but the
          term "font" might be applied either to one of these alone or to the
          whole typeface.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both traditional typesetting and modern usage, the word "font"
          refers to the delivery mechanism of the typeface design. In
          traditional typesetting, the font would be made from metal or wood.
          Today, the font is a digital file.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>i used google fonts for contents.</p>

      <article class="content">
        <p>
          The word font (traditionally spelled fount in British English, but in
          any case pronounced /ˈfɒnt/) derives from Middle French fonte
          "[something that has been] melted; a casting".[1] The term refers to
          the process of casting metal type at a type foundry.

          <h2>Metal type</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          In a manual printing (letterpress) house the word "font" would refer
          to a complete set of metal type that would be used to typeset an
          entire page. Upper- and lowercase letters get their names because of
          which case the metal type was located in for manual typesetting: the
          more distant upper case or the closer lower case. The same distinction
          is also referred to with the terms majuscule and minuscule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a digital typeface, a metal font would not include a single
          definition of each character, but commonly used characters (such as
          vowels and periods) would have more physical type-pieces included. A
          font when bought new would often be sold as (for example in a Roman
          alphabet) 12pt 14A 34a, meaning that it would be a size 12-point font
          containing 14 uppercase "A"s, and 34 lowercase "A"s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the characters would be provided in quantities appropriate
          for the distribution of letters in that language. Some metal type
          characters required in typesetting, such as dashes, spaces and
          line-height spacers, were not part of a specific font, but were
          generic pieces which could be used with any font.[2] Line spacing is
          still often called "leading", because the strips used for line spacing
          were made of lead (rather than the harder alloy used for other
          pieces). The reason for this spacing strip being made from "lead" was
          because lead was a softer metal than the traditional forged metal type
          pieces (which was part lead, antimony and tin) and would compress more
          easily when "locked-up" in the printing "chase" (i.e. a carrier for
          holding all the type together).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1880s–1890s, "hot lead" typesetting was invented, in which type
          was cast as it was set, either piece by piece (as in the Monotype
          technology) or in entire lines of type at one time (as in the Linotype
          technology).
