      Sihanoukville Province or Preah Sihanouk Province (Khmer: ខេត្តព្រះសីហនុ,
      'King Sihanouk') is a province (ខេត្ត, khaet) in southwest Cambodia on the
      Gulf of Thailand. The provincial capital, also called Sihanoukville, is a
      deep water port city and a steadily growing and diversifying urban center
      on an elevated peninsula.[4]

      First established as Kampong Som (Khmer: កំពង់សោម), the province was later
      renamed in honor of former King Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated the
      establishment of Sihanoukville city and the Sihanoukville municipality as
      this took place alongside the construction of the Sihanoukville Port,
      which commenced in June 1955. The only deep water port of Cambodia, it
      includes an oil terminal and a transport logistics facility.[5][6]

      Sihanoukville Province is divided into four districts, each with a
      distinct economic character, defined largely by location and access to
      resources.[7] In addition to the port and the growing tourism industry,
      the activities of countless NGOs and international investment have
      contributed to the rapid economic growth of the province over the course
      of the last decade.[8] Primary economic sectors are transport and
      logistics, process manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries, textiles, and
      real estate.

      The islands and beaches of Sihanoukville Province are an international
      tourist destination as visitor numbers have risen steadily since the
      late-20th century.[9][10]

    pSihanoukville municipality was elevated to provincial status on 22 December
    2008 after King Norodom Sihamoni signed a decree converting the
    municipalities of Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville into provinces, as well as
    incorporating Kompong Seila District.[11][12] As one of Cambodia's
    agriculturally and industrially most diverse provinces, its economic future
    has a solid basis, although the essential sectors of agriculture and tourism
    require strict and permanent administrative protection of local natural
    resources.[13][14][15]
