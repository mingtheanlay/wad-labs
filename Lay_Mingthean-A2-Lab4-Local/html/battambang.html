      Battambang (Khmer: បាត់ដំបង; Batdâmbâng) or Krong Battambang
      (ក្រុងបាត់ដំបង, Battambang City) is the capital city of Battambang
      province in northwestern Cambodia.

      Founded in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, Battambang is the leading
      rice-producing province of the country. For nearly 100 years it was a
      major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner
      Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer, with some
      ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of
      Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with Phnom Penh and Thailand.

      The city is situated on the Sangkae River, a tranquil, small body of water
      that winds its way picturesquely through Battambang Province. As with much
      of Cambodia, French Colonial architecture is a notable aspect of the city,
      with some of the best-preserved examples in the country. Now the
      government and Ministry of Culture and Fine Art are preparing documents to
      nominate The Old Town of Battambang in the list of UNESCO world heritage
      site along with The Old Town of Kampot and The Old Town of Kratie since
      2017.
