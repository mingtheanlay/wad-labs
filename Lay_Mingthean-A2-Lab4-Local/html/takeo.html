      Takeo (Khmer: ខេត្តតាកែវ, IPA: [taː kaew], literally "Crystal
      Grandfather") is a province (khaet) of Cambodia. Located in the south of
      Cambodia to the west of Bassac River, Takeo borders the provinces of
      Kampot to the west, Kampong Speu to the northwest and Kandal to the north
      and east. Its southern boundary is the international border with Vietnam.
      The provincial capital, recently known as the provincial town Doun Kaev
      (formerly called Takeo), is a small city with a population of 39,186.

      Takeo is often referred to as the "cradle of Khmer civilization" due to
      the former kingdom of Funan its successor, Water Chenla, being centered in
      the region.
