Dear Lecturer Heng Sovannarith,

Greetings lecturer, I am Lay Mingthean and I am from class A2 at the Royal University of Phnom Penh.
I am writing this email to submit HTML lab2 regarding the usage of text formatting in your slide and the researched text formatting.
Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
