      Kandal (Khmer: កណ្ដាល pronounced [kɑn.ˈɗaːl], "Central") is a province
      (khaet) of Cambodia located in the southeast portion of the country. It
      completely surrounds the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh and borders the
      provinces of Kampong Speu and Takeo to the west, Kampong Chhnang and
      Kampong Cham to the north, Prey Veng to the east, and shares an
      international border with Vietnam to the south. It is the second most
      populous province in Cambodia after the capital Phnom Penh.[3] Its capital
      and largest city is Ta Khmao, which is approximately 8 km south of central
      Phnom Penh. Kandal is one of the wealthier provinces in the country.
