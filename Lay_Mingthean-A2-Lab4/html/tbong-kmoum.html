      Tboung Khmum, or Tbong Khmum,[3] (Khmer: ខេត្តត្បូងឃ្មុំ, IPA: [tɓouŋ
      kʰmum], "Amber") is a province (khaet) of Cambodia located on the central
      lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong Cham to
      the west, Kratié to the north, Prey Veng to the south, and shares an
      international border with Vietnam to the east. Its capital and largest
      city is Suong. The province's name consists of two words in Khmer, tboung
      (gem, precious jewel) and khmum (bee), which together mean "amber".

      Tboung Khmum Province was formed when Kampong Cham Province was split in
      two by a royal decree signed on 31 December 2013 by King Norodom Sihamoni
      on the recommendation of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The request by Hun Sen's
      government to split the province, which was ostensibly for the purpose of
      improving administrative efficiency in the large province, was made after
      his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) lost the province to the
      opposition in the July 2013 elections.[4] The CPP won only eight of the
      available 18 National Assembly seats in Hun Sen's home province. The 10
      districts that remain in Khampong Cham province overwhelmingly voted for
      the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy, while
      five of the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form Tboung Khmum
      Province were won solidly by the CPP.[5]
