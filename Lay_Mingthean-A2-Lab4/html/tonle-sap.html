      Tonlé Sap (Khmer: ទន្លេសាប IPA: [tunleː saːp], literally large river
      (tonle); fresh, not salty (sap), commonly translated to 'great lake') is a
      seasonally inundated freshwater lake, the Tonlé Sap Lake and an attached
      river, the 120 km (75 mi) long Tonlé Sap River, that connects the lake to
      the Mekong River.[1] They form the central part of a complex hydrological
      system, in the 12,876 km2 (4,971 sq mi) Cambodian floodplain covered with
      a mosaic of natural and agricultural habitats that the Mekong replenishes
      with water and sediments annually. The central plain formation is the
      result of millions of years of Mekong alluvial deposition and discharge.
      From a geological perspective, the Tonlé Sap Lake and Tonlé Sap River are
      a current freeze-frame representation of the slowly but continuously
      shifting lower Mekong basin. Annual fluctuation of the Mekong's water
      volume, supplemented by the Asian monsoon regime, causes a unique[2] flow
      reversal of the Tonle Sap River.[3]

      The Tonlé Sap Lake occupies a geological depression (the lowest lying
      area) of the vast alluvial and lacustrine floodplain in the lower Mekong
      basin, which has been induced by the collision of the Indian Plate with
      the Eurasian Plate.[4][5] The lake's size, length and water volume varies
      considerably over the course of a year from an area of around 2,500 km2
      (965 sq mi), a volume of 1 km3 (0.24 cu mi) and a length of 160 km (99 mi)
      at the end of the dry season in late-April to an area of up to 16,000 km2
      (6,178 sq mi), a volume of 80 km3 (19 cu mi) and a length of 250 km (160
      mi) as the Mekong maximum and the peak of the southwest monsoon's
      precipitation culminate in September and early-October.[6]

      As one of the world's most varied and productive ecosystems the region has
      always been of central importance for Cambodia's food supply. It proved
      capable of largely maintaining the Angkorean civilization, the largest
      pre-industrial settlement complex in world history.[7] Directly and
      indirectly it affects the livelihood of large numbers of a predominantly
      rural population. Due to ineffective administration and widespread
      indifference towards environmental issues, the lake and its surrounding
      ecosystem are coming under increasing pressure from over-exploitation and
      habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss.[8] All Mekong riparian
      states have either announced or already implemented plans to increasingly
      exploit the river's hydroelectric potential. A succession of international
      facilities that dam the river's mainstream is likely to be the gravest
      danger yet for the entire Tonle Sap eco-region.[9]

      The largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, it contains an exceptional
      large variety of interconnected eco-regions with a high degree of
      biodiversity and is therefore a biodiversity hotspot. It was designated a
      UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1997.[10]
