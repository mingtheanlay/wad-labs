      Oddar Meanchey (Khmer: ឧត្ដរមានជ័យ IPA: [ʔutdɑː miən cɨj]; 'victorious
      North') is a province (khaet) of Cambodia in the remote northwest. It
      borders the provinces of Banteay Meanchey to the west, Siem Reap to the
      south and Preah Vihear to the east. Its long northern boundary demarcates
      part of Cambodia's international border with Thailand. The capital is
      Samraong town.

      The province was created on 27 April 1999, after being carved from the
      northern half of Siem Reap Province and part of Banteay Meanchey. It
      existed as a province already from 1962 to 1970 under Norodom Sihanouk's
      Sangkum Reastr Niyum regime, but later became an administrative
      no-man's-land, with its status alternating between a province and a
      district under successive regimes.[2]
