      Mondulkiri, officially Mondul Kiri[3] (Khmer: មណ្ឌលគិរី, IPA: [mɔn ˌdɔːl
      ki ˈriː], "Center of Mountains"), is a province (khaet) of Cambodia.
      Bordering the provinces of Kratié to the west, Stung Treng to the
      northwest, Ratanakiri to the north and the country of Vietnam to the east
      and south, it is the most sparsely populated province in the country
      despite being the largest in land area. The province was created in 1961
      from the eastern part of Kratié Province. The capital is the town of
      Senmonorom.
