      Kep (Khmer: កែប pronounced [kaep]), also romanized as Kaeb (កែប,
      "Saddle"), formally known as Kep Province (ខេត្តកែប), is the smallest
      province (khaet) of Cambodia[2] covering 336 km2 (130 sq mi), with a
      population of 41,798.[1] It is one of the newest Cambodian provinces,
      together with Pailin, Sihanoukville and Tboung Khmum, created by Royal
      Decree on 22 December 2008, which separated Kep Municipality & Damnak
      Chang'aeur District from the Kampot Province, as well as adjusting several
      provincial borders.[3][4] It is both the smallest and least populous
      province of Cambodia. The provincial capital is Kep District and the
      province contains the Kep National Park.
