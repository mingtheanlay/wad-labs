      Ratanakiri or Ratanak Kiri[3] (Khmer: រតនគិរី[4] IPA: [ˌreə̯̆ʔ taʔ ˈnaʔ ki
      ˈriː]), is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of
      Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of
      Laos and Vietnam to the north and east, respectively. The province extends
      from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a hilly
      plateau between the Tonle San and Tonle Srepok rivers, to tropical
      deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have
      scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.

      For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer
      Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's
      early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by
      neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French
      colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia's
      independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life. The Khmer Rouge
      built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during
      the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the
      province is altering traditional ways of life.

      Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over
      1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages
      of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture.
      Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its
      infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health
      indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39
      years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just
      under half of the population illiterate.
