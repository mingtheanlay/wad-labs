      Kampot (Khmer: ក្រុងកំពត) is a city in southern Cambodia and the capital
      of Kampot Province. It is on the Praek Tuek Chhu River southeast of the
      Elephant Mountains and around 5 km (3 mi) from the Gulf of Thailand.[1]
      Kampot was the capital of the Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot
      under French rule and Cambodia's most important seaport after the loss of
      the Mekong Delta and before the establishment of Sihanoukville.[2] Its
      center is, unlike most Cambodian provincial capitals, composed of 19th
      century French colonial architecture. The region and town are known for
      high quality pepper, which is exported worldwide.[3] It is also known for
      its Kampot fish sauce,[4] and durian.[5] Now the government and Ministry
      of Culture and Fine Art are preparing documents to nominate The Old Town
      of Kampot in the list of UNESCO world heritage site along with The Old
      Town of Battambang and The Old Town of Kratie since 2017.
