      Kampong Cham (Khmer: ខេត្តកំពង់ចាម, IPA: [kɑmpɔːŋ caːm], "Port of the
      Chams") is a province (khaet) of Cambodia located on the central lowlands
      of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong Chhnang to the
      west, Kampong Thom and Kratié to the north, Tbong Khmum to the east, and
      Prey Veng and Kandal to the south. Kampong Cham was officially divided
      into two provinces on 31 December 2013 in what was seen by many as a
      political move by the ruling party.[2][3] All land west of the Mekong
      remained Kampong Cham while land east of the river became Tbong Khmum
      province. Prior to this division, Kampong Cham extended eastward to the
      international border with Vietnam, was the eleventh largest province in
      Cambodia, and with a population of 1,680,694, was the most populous
      province in Cambodia. Its capital and largest city is Kampong Cham.
