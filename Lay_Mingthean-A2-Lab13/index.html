              The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP; Khmer:
              សាកលវិទ្យាល័យភូមិន្ទភ្នំពេញ, French: Université royale de Phnom
              Penh) is a national university of Cambodia, located in the capital
              Phnom Penh. Established in 1960, it is the country's largest
              university. It hosts around 20,000 students in undergraduate and
              postgraduate programs. It offers degrees in fields such as
              sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering as well as
              vocational courses in fields such as information technology,
              electronics, psychology and tourism. RUPP provides Cambodia's
              foremost degree-level language programs through the Institute of
              Foreign Languages. RUPP has full membership in the ASEAN
              University Network (AUN).
            </p>
            <p>
              RUPP has over 420 full-time staff. All of its 294 academic staff
              hold tertiary qualifications, including 24 PhDs and 132 Master's
              degrees. They are supported by 140 administrative and maintenance
              staff. The university maintains linkage networks with Cambodian
              and international NGOs, universities and government ministries. As
              a result, international and non-government organizations and
              government offices regularly contribute adjunct faculty members to
              help expand RUPP's capacity.

            <p>
              The Royal University of Phnom Penh began as the Royal Khmer
              University in 1960. It opened during a period of intense growth in
              Cambodia and expanded to include a National Institute of Judicial
              and Economic Studies, a Royal School of Medicine, a National
              School of Commerce, a National Pedagogical Institute, a Faculty of
              Letters and Human Sciences, and a Faculty of Science and
              Technology. The language of instruction during this period was
              French.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the growth of Cambodia's economy and an assertion of its
              historical role, modern buildings for that time were constructed
              in the style of the New Khmer Architecture, which has influences
              of Bauhaus, European post-modern architecture, and traditions from
              Angkor.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the establishment of the Khmer Republic in 1970, the Royal
              Khmer University became the Phnom Penh University. Between 1965
              and 1975 there were nine faculties: the Ecole Normale Supérieure
              (Higher Normal College), Letters and Humanities, Science,
              Pharmacy, Law and Economics, Medicine and Dentistry, Commerce,
              Pedagogy, and the Languages Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Democratic Kampuchea period of 1975-1979 saw the closure and
              destruction of schools, the decimation of the teaching service and
              the cessation of formal education at the hands of the Khmer Rouge.
              Phung Ton, the dean of Phnom Penh University, was arrested,
              tortured and murdered at Tuol Sleng (S-21).[1] During this period
              Phnom Penh University and all other educational institutions in
              Cambodia were closed down. Under this regime an education was
              perceived as a dangerous asset. Hence, the educated were targeted,
              and most of the university's teachers and students were killed.
              The campus was abandoned and remained deserted for almost five
              years. Of the educated people who survived, few remained in
              Cambodia once the borders reopened following the Vietnamese
              invasion that toppled Khmer Rouge rule.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1980, under the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Ecole
              Normale Supérieure (Higher Normal College) reopened, again
              teaching predominantly in French. In 1981, the Institute of
              Foreign Languages (IFL) began, initially training students to
              become Vietnamese and Russian teachers. The purpose of both
              colleges was to provide surviving graduates of primary school or
              above with crash courses in teaching.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1988, the college and the IFL merged to create Phnom Penh
              University, and in 1996 the name was changed to the Royal
              University of Phnom Penh.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the past decade, the university has grown and now includes
              the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities,
              and the Institute of Foreign Languages. In 2001, RUPP began its
              first postgraduate degrees with the graduate diploma and Master's
              courses in Tourism Development. A Master's degree in Biodiversity
              Conservation began in 2005 in partnership with conservation NGO
              Fauna and Flora International[4].

              <h2>Royal University of Phnom Penh Campus 2</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              The Campus 2 of the Royal University of Phnom Penh was built
              between 1989 and 1991 with the support of the Vietnamese Communist
              government. It is located on five hectares of land on Russian
              Boulevard. Apart from the classrooms of the Departments of
              Geography, History and Sociology, there is also the Royal Academy
              of Cambodia on the compound that uses the former canteen as office
              space. The former university dormitories house the research center
              of the Royal Academy of Cambodia.

              Pom adds that the architecture of the new campus was influenced
              both by the ancient style of Khmer temples from the Angkor period
              and by a visit to some modern buildings such as the Hotel
              Cambodiana and the original university campus, where the political
              training center was located at that time. Pom says: “We believe
              that the two ponds and its bridges were inspired by the ponds of
              the previous school (today’s IFL) and Angkor Wat. It makes the
              students feel calm and cool during the classes and helps them to
              relax.“ In ancient temple architecture, the Cambodian ancestors
              usually adorned the buildings by surrounding them with ponds and
              added bridges decorated with dragon heads, he adds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The school was supposed to teach the students Marxist–Leninist
              theories and how mankind would evolve toward socialism. When the
              Vietnamese left Cambodia in 1992, the school was never opened; the
              Cambodian Communist government decided to hand the building over
              to the Ministry of Education.

            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be

            scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
            documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
            documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
            a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
            appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of
            HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
            provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
            links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
            written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
          </p>
          <p>
            surround and provide information about document text and may include
            other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
