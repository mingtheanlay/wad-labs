      With the increasing importance of computers and information technology
      (IT) in the workplace, computer knowledge is an indispensable skill for
      almost all professional fields. The Bachelor of Science in Computer
      Science degree provides students with necessary training and technical
      knowledge in various aspects of software for the IT industry. The course
