    <h1>Python Programming Language</h1>
    <p>
      Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
      language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's
      design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
      significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented
      approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
      large-scale projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
      programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural),
      object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as
      a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.
      Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions
      and a garbage collection system with reference counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is
      not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run
      unmodified on Python 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned
      for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore
      the last Python 2 release."[30] No more security patches or other
      improvements will be released for it.[31][32] With Python 2's end-of-life,
      only Python 3.6.x[33] and later are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global
      community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and
      open-source[34] reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the
      Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and
      CPython development.
