    <h1>English Language</h1>
    <p>
      English is a West Germanic language first spoken in early medieval England
      which eventually became the leading language of international discourse in
      today's world.[4][5][6] It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient
      Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later
      took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on
      the Baltic Sea. English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon,
      while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic
      languages, particularly Old Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as
      Latin and French.[7][8][9]

      English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The
      earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects
      brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are
      collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th
      century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which
      English was influenced by Old French, in particular through its Old Norman
      dialect.[10][11] Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with
      the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King
      James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.[12]

      Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century
      by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States.
      Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries,
      English has become the leading language of international discourse and the
      lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science,
      navigation and law.[4] Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual
      change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern, with a rich
      inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly
      analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed
      subject–verb–object word order and a complex syntax.[13] Modern English
      relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of
      complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions,
      interrogatives and some negation.
