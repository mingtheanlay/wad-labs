    <h1>My Own Experience</h1>
    <p>
      For my experience, this school is the best out of the best. I learn a lot
      from this, besides English Language I learn a lot of skill, such as,
      social skill, soft skill, critical thinking, and much more. This institute
      is more than language school in my opinion, the lecture is outstanding and
      know what they are doing in their field.
