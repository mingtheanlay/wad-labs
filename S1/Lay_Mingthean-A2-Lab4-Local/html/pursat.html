      Pursat (Khmer: ខេត្តពោធិ៍សាត់, IPA: [poː sat]; "drifting Bodhi") is a
      province (khaet) of Cambodia. It is in the western part of the country and
      borders clockwise from the north: Battambang Province, the Tonlé Sap,
      Kampong Chhnang Province, Kampong Speu Province, Koh Kong Province, and
      Thailand. It lies between the Tonle Sap and the northern end of the
      Cardamom Mountains. The Pursat River bisects the province, running from
      the Cardamoms in the west to the Tonle Sap in the east.

      The fourth largest province of Cambodia in area, Pursat ranks only 14th in
      population. The region is accessible by National Highway 5, by boat, rail
      and by numerous smaller roads. The capital, Pursat town, lies 174
      kilometres north west of Phnom Penh by road and 106 kilometres south east
      of Battambang.[3]

      Pursat is home to Wat Bakan, considered to be among the oldest active
      pagodas in Cambodia and revered as one of the most holy sites of Cambodian
      Buddhism.[4] The province also hosts the annual River Run Race, an event
      that includes 5 km and 10 km races that generally follow the path of the
      Pursat River for men and women, including those requiring wheelchairs.
      Since its inaugural race in 2007, the event has grown to the second
      largest of its kind in Cambodia[5]
