      Stung Treng[2][3] (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង, IPA: [stɘŋ traeːŋ] "River of Reeds";
      Lao: ຊຽງແຕງ Xiang Taeng; Thai: เชียงแตง Chiang Taeng 'City of Melons'), is
      a province of Cambodia in the northeast. It borders the provinces of
      Ratanakiri to the east, Mondulkiri and Kratie to the south and Kampong
      Thom and Preah Vihear to the west. Its northern boundary is Cambodia's
      international border with Laos. The Mekong River bisects the province. The
      province is mostly covered by forest, but logging and fishing put high
      pressure on the forest and fishery reserves.[4]
