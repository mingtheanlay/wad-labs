      Phnom Penh (/(pə)ˌnɒm ˈpɛn, ˌpnɒm -/;[5][6][7] Khmer: ភ្នំពេញ, romanized:
      phnum pɨñ, IPA: [pʰnʊm ˈpɨɲ]; literally "Penh's Hill"), formerly known as
      Krong Chaktomuk Serimongkul (Khmer: ក្រុងចតុមុខសិរីមង្គល, lit. 'City of
      the Brahma's Faces') or shortly known as Krong Chaktomuk (Khmer:
      ក្រុងចតុមុខ),[8] is the capital and most populous city in Cambodia. Phnom
      Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia,
      and has grown to become the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural
      center.

      Once known as the "Pearl of Asia," it was considered one of the loveliest
      French-built cities in Indochina[9] in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with
      Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist
      destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its
      historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in
      1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497.[10] It
      regained its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There
      are a number of surviving colonial-era buildings scattered along the grand
      boulevards.

      On the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is
      home to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian
      population.[3] The Phnom Penh metropolitan area includes 5 districts of
      Kandal Province.[11]
