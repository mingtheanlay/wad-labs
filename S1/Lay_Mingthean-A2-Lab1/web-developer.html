    <h1>Web Developer</h1>
    <p>
      A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically
      engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a
      clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python or Java in the server,
      and http for communications between client and server. A web content
      management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.
