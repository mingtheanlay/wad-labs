      Professional communication, encompasses written, oral, visual and digital
      communication within a workplace context. This discipline blends together
      pedagogical principles of rhetoric, technology, software, and learning
      theory to improve and deliver communication in a variety of settings
      ranging from technical writing to usability and digital media design to
      more effectively communicate in the business world.

      It is a new discipline that focuses on the study of information and the
      ways it is created, managed, distributed, and consumed. Since
      communications is a rapidly changing area, technological progress seems to
      often outpace the number of available expert practitioners. This creates a
      demand for skilled communicators.

      Communication skills are critical to a business because all businesses, to
      varying degrees, involve the following: writing, reading, editing,
      speaking, listening, software applications, computer graphics, and
      Internet research. Job candidates with professional communication
      backgrounds are more likely to bring to the organization sophisticated
      perspectives on society, culture, science, and technology.

      The field is closely related to that of technical communication, though
      professional communication encompasses a wider variety of skills.

      help me find a good job in the future and every company need this subject
      to communicate with cliet or find the fund. Moreover, it might help
      compliment my computer science skill I think.
