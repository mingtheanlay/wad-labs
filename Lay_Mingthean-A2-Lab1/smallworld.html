    <h1>My Own Experience</h1>
    <p>
      For my own experience, I spent 6 months there on iternship. Beecause of
      this internship, I get to know more about the Computer Science field, and
      experience the work as a Startup and working in an office as a team.
      Moreover , I can communicate effectively with management and instructors
      and openly accepted critiques and suggestions for areas of improvement.
